  - `docs/04_NEXT_ACTIONS.md`
  - `docs/05_AI_WORK_LOG.md`
  - `prompts/management-agent.md`
  - `.cursor/rules/project-rules.mdc`
- Existing files updated additively:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

  - `docs/mvp-progress-report.md`
  - `docs/prototype-audit.md`
  - `docs/the_luxe_data_model_source_of_truth.md`
  - backend and frontend domain files inspected during audit
- Result: Pending human review.
- Verification: Repository inspection, `docs/mvp-progress-report.md` review, and git diff/status review. No app tests were run.

### 2026-06-05 - Codex - Memory Consistency Audit

- Tool: Codex
- Request: Audit the new project memory system for consistency with `docs/mvp-progress-report.md` and make only small additive or corrective edits.

  - `docs/01_ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `docs/03_PROGRESS_LOG.md`
  - `docs/04_NEXT_ACTIONS.md`
  - `docs/05_AI_WORK_LOG.md`
- Summary: Corrected memory wording from in-progress scaffolding to existing memory docs, added data-model authority guidance, clarified backend API route coverage, made the best next engineering task file-specific, and recorded the audit.
- Human review status: Pending
- Verification: Required files were read, `docs/mvp-progress-report.md` was used as the current-state check, and git status/diff were reviewed. No app tests were run.
- Decision log update needed: No
- Next action: Fix the frontend API base environment mismatch in `frontend/lib/api/http-client.ts`.

### 2026-06-05 - Codex - AI Development Team Workflow

- Tool: Codex
- Task given to AI: Add minimal AI development team workflow with Management Agent, Coding Agent, and QA Agent.

- Issues introduced: None known.
- Follow-up needed: Run one real coding task through the Management -> Coding -> QA workflow.
- Verification: `git status --short`, `git diff --check`, scoped diffs for modified workflow docs, and new-file diffs for the new agent prompts.
- Decision log update needed: No
- Next action: Test the AI team workflow on one small, scoped coding task.
